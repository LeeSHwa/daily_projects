# Daily Coding Practice & Algorithm Study ðŸš€

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills through daily practice. Here, you'll find me tackling coding challenges, exploring new programming languages, and organizing my studies on data structures and algorithms.
## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic into the following directories:

-   **/1. baekjoon**: Solutions for problems from the Baekjoon Online Judge.
-   **/2. DataStructure**: Implementations of core data structures.
-   **/3. Sort**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms.
-   **/4. Contest**: Code from programming contests.
-   **/99. Previous**: An archive of older solutions.
